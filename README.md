# Ars Clicker

[Ars Almal](https://youtube.com/@ArsAlmal) is a Virtual Youtuber affiliated with [Nijisanji](https://www.nijisanji.jp/). She has a very cute and small face. But how big can she go?

**Live deployment**: [ars.2434.systems](https://ars.2434.systems)

## Concept

Every click on Ars increases her face's width by **1m** (increases as updates come along). Each click also generates **1 ARS** currency, which can be used to buy **Events** or **Items** in the **Shop**.

Current **Events** in the Shop:

| Event        | Description                                | Cost |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------ | ---- |
| Spin the Ars | Each click spins her by 1 degree clockwise | 200  |

This project is being deployed on [Vercel](https://vercel.app).
